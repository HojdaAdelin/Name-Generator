# Name-Generator
Name Generator is an app that generate names for projects or anything. It was created using Qt framework and C++.

# Qt framework

For the GUI of this project I used [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)\
Qt source code modifications are non-proprietary.\
Qt is a interface tool for programmers that is easy to use and make life easier :)
